## Before You Start:
It’s important that you talk to your doctor before you start the program. This is especially true if you are on any medication. You’ll need their help to safely adjust your dosage.

As a general rule, if you notice your blood sugar drops to normal or below normal, use the advice given by your doctor to raise your blood sugar to safe levels.

If this happens over a few days, you must tell your doctor you may need to adjust your medication. Ask your doctor for guidelines in advance with specific blood sugar targets as well as how much to adjust your medication.

Below we have included a guide you can print out for your doctor so that they can better understand the program and the studies it is based on. Have them review this to help you plan accordingly.
