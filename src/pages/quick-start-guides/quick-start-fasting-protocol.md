So you’re taking the next step to naturally manage your blood sugar!

Let’s start by explaining some basics: **WHAT IS FASTING?**

Fasting is the act of withholding consumption of food for periods of time. In general, during these fasting periods you are not to consume any calories. That said, unsweetened drinks are permitted including: coffee, tea, water. A fast that permits drinks like this is called a wet fast. Fasting has been used effectively as a technique to support healthy blood sugar regulation.

With the support of your doctor, and their approval, The Sugar Balance Solution program uses a very easy form of fasting that you can actually do every day!

It’s called **Intermittent Fasting:** This type of fasting involves fasting for shorter periods on a regular basis, like daily, for instance. These types of fasts are easier to do and can be done more frequently as a result without a lot of effort and strain while getting many of the benefits.

The intermittent fasting that is suggested is what is called **16:8**

In this form, you will **fast from food for 16 hours,** and have an **8 hour eating “window”.**
