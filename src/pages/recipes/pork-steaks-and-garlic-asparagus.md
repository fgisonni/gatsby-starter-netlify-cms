## INGREDIENTS

**For pork steaks**

* 1 teaspoon olive oil or coconut oil
* 1 medium pork steaks (about 150 g / 4-5 oz each)
* ¼ teaspoon sea salt
* ¼ teaspoon onion powder (optional)
* Generous pinch of black pepper
* 1 tablespoons Dijon mustard (wholegrain or yellow are also fine)

**For the asparagus**

* 1/2 bunch of asparagus, harder ends trimmed
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 3 large cloves of garlic, sliced
* Pinch of salt

**For the salad**  

* 3 cups baby spinach
* Juice of ½ lemon
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds (black or white)

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Heat oil in a large frying an over medium-high heat. Season the pork steaks with salt, onion powder and pepper and place in the middle of the pan. Cook for 3.5 minutes on each side.
2. While the steaks are cooking, add asparagus spears and garlic to the same frying pan (around the pork steaks, if it’s big enough pan) or to another hot frying pan and drizzle with olive oil. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring a few times, to ensure even cooking. Season with a little sea salt, to taste.
3. While the pork and the asparagus are cooking, add the watercress salad to a bowl and drizzle with lemon juice and olive oil. Toss through with some sesame seeds.
