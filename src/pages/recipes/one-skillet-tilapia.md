## INGREDIENTS

- 1  tbsp olive oil
- 1 tomatoes, chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
- 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
- 1/2 cup tomato sauce
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- ¼ cup olives, pitted and halved
- 1 tbsp capers, rinsed and drained
- 1 tbsp jalapeno peppers, chopped
- 1/4 cup chicken stock
- 1 tsp oregano
- Salt and ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 tilapia fillets

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a large skillet (I used 11" cast iron skillet) heat oil over medium high heat. Add chopped tomatoes, sliced bell peppers, and onion. Season with salt and stir. Reduce heat to medium, cover with a lid and cook for about 3-4 minutes until vegetables are tender.
2. Add tomato sauce, minced garlic, olives, capers, jalapeno peppers and white wine. Season again with salt, freshly ground pepper and oregano. Stir well.
3. Season both sides of tilapia filet with salt and freshly ground black peppers, and place on top of the Veracruz sauce. Spoon some of the sauce on top of the tilapia filets. Cover with a lid and continue to cook on the stove over medium heat for about 5 - 6 minutes, or until fish flakes easily with a fork.
