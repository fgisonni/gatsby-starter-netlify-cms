## INGREDIENTS:

* 1 cup chicken broth
* 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce (or tamari, if gluten-free)
* 1 tablespoon corn starch
* 1/2 pound chicken breast cutlets or fillets
* 2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
* 6 small heads baby bok choy, halved lengthwise
* 2 cloves garlic, chopped
* 1 teaspoon sesame seeds (optional)

## INSTRUCTIONS:

1. **Prepare the sauce and the chicken fillets**: In a small bowl, whisk together the chicken broth, soy sauce, and corn starch. Season the chicken fillets lightly on both sides with salt and pepper.
2. **Sear the bok choy**: Heat one tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. When the oil begins to shimmer and you see a wisp of smoke rise from the skillet, use a pair of kitchen tongs to add the bok choy to the skillet in a single layer, sliced side down. It's fine to crowd the pan for this recipe. Be careful as you add the bok choy since the oil will sputter a bit; wear oven mitts if needed.
3. **Sear the chicken**: Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Add the chicken fillets to the pan. Sear the fillets for 4 minutes a side, until just cooked through and well browned. Transfer the cooked fillets to the serving plate on top of the bok choy.
4. **Make the sauce**: Add the garlic to the skillet and stir just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Give the broth/soy sauce mixture a final stir to mix in any cornstarch that has settled to the bottom of the bowl, then pour the mixture into the skillet. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Simmer the sauce until thickened.
5. **To serve**: Pour the sauce over chicken and bok choy. Sprinkle with sesame seeds, if desired.
