## INGREDIENTS

* 1 ripe avocados
* 2 fresh eggs
* 1 tablespoon chopped green onion
* Salt and pepper to taste

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 400 F degrees.
2. Line a baking sheet or baking pan with foil or parchment paper (for easier cleanup).
3. Cut avocados in half and scoop an additional 1-2 tablespoons of the avocado flesh out to create a larger nest for the eggs.
4. Position the avocado halves propped against the baking dish or touching the other avocados snugly to avoid spilling over. You can also place a small ramekin and prop them against the avocados.
5. Gently crack one egg in each avocado half - if needed - save some of the egg whites in another bowl if the avocado well is too small.
6. Bake for 13-18 minutes, or until the whites are set and the egg yolks are cooked to your liking.
7. 13-14 min. - softer yolks
8. 15-16 min. - medium yolks
9. 17-18 min. - hard boiled yolks
10. Top with chopped green onion, salt and pepper to taste
