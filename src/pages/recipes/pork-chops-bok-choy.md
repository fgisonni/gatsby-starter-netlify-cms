## INGREDIENTS

* 1 pork chop
* 3 cups of bok choy
* 1 garlic clove, finely minced
* Sea salt & pepper to taste

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Season pork chop with salt and pepper.
2. Place in a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Move the pan around quickly so it doesn’t stick. Add water as needed. Wait until seared and flip.
3. Once pork chop is cooked, remove from pan. Don’t discard the oil left in pan.
4. Add chopped bok choy and garlic to pan. Cook until tender. Add salt to taste.
5. Add pork chop back to pan with bok choy to re-heat and absorb juices.
