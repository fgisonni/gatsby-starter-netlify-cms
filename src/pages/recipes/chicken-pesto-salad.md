## INGREDIENTS

* 1 chicken breast, precooked and cubed
* 1 medium zucchini, cubed
* 1/2 cup broccoli florets, cut small
* 1/2 cup sliced grape tomatoes
* 4 basil leaves
* 1/8 cup walnuts
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* ½ tablespoon lemon juice
* Salt & Pepper

## INGREDIENTS

1. Prepare the veggies: Preheat the oven to 450°F. Toss the broccoli and zucchini in avocado oil. Spread them out in an oven-safe dish and place in oven. Roast for 20 minutes, until zucchini is cooked through and broccoli begins to brown. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.
2. Prepare the pesto: in a food processor, pulse the garlic and nuts until coarsely ground. Add the olive oil, lemon juice, and nutrition yeast, along with a pinch of salt and a few cracks of pepper. Pulse once or twice, then add the basil and pulse until ground into a paste.
3. Use a spatula to scoop the pesto into a serving dish. Fold the tomatoes, olives, cubes chicken, and cooled veggies into the pesto.
4. Serve warm or chilled. Great on greens, crackers, or straight from the bowl.
