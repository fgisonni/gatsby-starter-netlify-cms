## INGREDIENTS

**Chicken Marinade:**

* 1 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp ground black pepper

**Main Dish:**

* 4 chicken drumsticks
* 1 medium sized zucchini
* 1/2 pint cherry tomatoes
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves
* 1/8 cup pitted kalamata olives
* 1 garlic clove, roughly chopped.
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* About 1 Tbspn olive oil to drizzle over top
* Salt and Pepper to add over top

## INSTRUCTIONS

**Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F.**

1. Make the marinade: Crush garlic, add lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper to bowl and mix together. Add the chicken drumsticks into a large dish and pour the marinade over top of the chicken. Ensure the drumsticks are evenly coated. Cover and leave to marinade for 1 hour.
2. Cut the zucchini in half and then slice each half lengthways into thin vertical strips - about 3mm in width.
3. Remove the chicken drumsticks from the marinade and place drumsticks in a large baking or casserole dish. Drizzle the remainder of the marinade over the chicken drumsticks.
4. Place the chicken in the oven and cook for 15 minutes.
5. After 15 minutes remove the chicken from the oven. Add the zucchini, tomatoes, garlic cloves, and half of the parsley evenly around each drumstick.
6. Drizzle olive oil over top of chicken and vegetables and sprinkle salt, pepper and oregano over entire dish. Place the dish back in the oven and cook for another 30 minutes.
7. Remove after 45 minutes. The juices from the chicken should be clear - if not cook for another 5-10 minutes.
8. Add the remainder of the fresh parsley to the dish then serve with a simple side salad.
