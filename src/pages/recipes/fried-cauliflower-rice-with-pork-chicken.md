## INGREDIENTS:

* 1 head cauliflower riced, or 12 oz (came out just shy of 4 cups)
* 3 slices thick sliced paleo turkey bacon chopped into small bite size pieces
* 2-3 tbsp rendered turkey bacon fat or other cooking fat of choice (coconut oil or ghee)
* 1 egg whisked
* 4 scallions white and green parts separated - thinly sliced
* 1 large handful kale chopped
* 1 inch chunk fresh ginger peeled and grated (about 2 tsp)
* 3 cloves garlic minced
* 1 boneless skinless chicken breasts or thighs precooked (or any precooked chicken you have on hand) and chopped into bite size pieces
* 4 Tbsp soy sauce
* 2 Tbsp pure sesame oil
* Sea salt to taste

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Have all ingredients chopped and ready to go before beginning.
2. Heat a wok or large non-stick skillet over med-hi heat, add the chopped turkey bacon or ground pork*. Cook, stirring, until browned (2-3 mins), then remove to a plate using a slotted spoon, turn off heat.
3. Pour the rendered fat into a glass bowl for later use. Reserve 2 tsp fat to scramble the eggs. Return heat to medium high and add the eggs, scramble, chop into pieces and remove to a plate (with the turkey bacon is fine)
4. Keeping the heat on med-med/hi, Add another 1-2 tbsp cooking fat to the pan, then add the chopped kale and a bit of sea salt, stir to coat and cook, stirring, about 5 minutes to soften.
5. Add the white and light green part of the scallions, garlic and ginger and cook another 2-3 minutes, stirring.
6. Add the riced cauliflower and stir to coat with the cooked veggies. Add all the coconut aminos and sesame oil and stir to coat, continue to cook another 3 minutes or so, then stir in the chopped chicken, scrambled eggs, and turkey bacon or ground pork, stir and cook another minute, remove from heat.
7. Sprinkle with a bit more sea salt or coconut aminos to taste, then garnish with thinly sliced scallions (green parts) and serve! Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 4 days - it reheats well to bring leftovers to work!
