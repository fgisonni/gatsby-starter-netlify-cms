## INGREDIENTS

* 1 teaspoons olive oil
* 2 large portobello mushroom caps, cleaned and gills removed (gently scrape it out with a spoon)
* 1 small onion, diced
* 1/4 pound ground turkey
* Handful of baby spinach leaves
* 6-8 grape tomatoes, sliced (and roasted if you prefer)
* Salt and pepper, to taste (Italian seasoning would be great too!)

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a large skillet over medium high heat, melt oil. Place the mushrooms into the skillet and let cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Flip them halfway through.
2. Set aside on a plate.
3. In the same skillet, add the onion and saut√© until softened, about 3 minutes. Then add the ground turkey to the pan and break it up into small pieces with a spatula or wooden spoon. Cook until it's all cooked through. Sprinkle salt and pepper and other seasonings, if using.
4. Remove from heat and add the baby spinach leaves. The residual heat should wilt the spinach easily.
5. To assemble: use a small spoon and scoop the turkey spinach filling into the caps of the mushrooms. Top with grape tomatoes. Serve warm!
