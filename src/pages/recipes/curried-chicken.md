## INGREDIENTS

* 1 medium chicken breasts
* 1/2 small yellow onion, diced
* 1/4 tsp. pure liquid stevia or low carb sweetener of your choice
* 1/4 tsp. ground ginger
* 1 tbsp. garlic powder
* 1 tsp. curry powder
* 1 tsp. ground cumin
* 1/4 tps. ground cloves
* 1 tbsp. apple cider vinegar
* 1 tbsp. lemon juice
* 1 tbsp. arrowroot powder (or cornstarch) 
* 1 cup cauliflower rice (chopped, shredded or riced cauliflower) 

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Put all ingredients into your slow cooker and insert and stir to coat the chicken with the spices.
2. Add 1 cup water to pot; rest chicken on the basket-style grate that the comes with to cook the chicken above the water instead of in it.  
3. Cook on the Meat setting for 40 minutes (or less time based on type of pressure cooker you have).  
4. Once cooked through, transfer the chicken to a plate or bowl for shredding.  
5. In the liquid that is left behind, add the arrowroot powder or cornstarch to thicken it. Whisk thoroughly to avoid clumps.   
6. Pan fry the cauliflower rice lightly for 3-4 minutes until slightly softened, remove and plate.  
7. Return the shredded chicken to the sauce and serve over cauliflower rice to complete the dish.
