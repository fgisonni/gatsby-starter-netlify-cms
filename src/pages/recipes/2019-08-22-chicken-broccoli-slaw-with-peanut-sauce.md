## INGREDIENTS

**FOR THE PEANUT SAUCE**

* 2 tsp natural  peanut butter
* 2 tsp sesame oil
* 2 tsp soy sauce (use a gluten-free or low-sodium option, if necessary)
* ½ stevia

**FOR THE SALAD**

* ½ (about 2 cups) bag broccoli slaw
* 1 cooked chicken breasts, chopped (I love using leftover chicken cooked with this 3-ingredient marinade )
* 1/4 cup peanuts
* Optional extras: 1 small red bell pepper, 2 thinly sliced scallions; few sprigs chopped fresh parsley

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a small bowl, thoroughly combine all of the peanut sauce ingredients.\*\* (If the peanut butter is cold, warming it slightly in the microwave or allowing it to sit at room temperature for a few minutes will allow it to mix more easily with the other ingredients.)
2. To a large bowl, add the broccoli slaw, chicken, and optional extras. Pour the sauce over top and toss to thoroughly coat.
3. At this point, you may cover the salad and refrigerate until ready to eat. Sprinkle with peanuts just before serving.
