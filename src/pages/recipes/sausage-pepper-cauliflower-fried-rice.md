## INGREDIENTS

* 1/4 cauliflower head, cut into small florets
* 1/2 red or green bell pepper, sliced
* 1/2 onion, sliced
* 5 oz smoked chicken sausage, sliced (not ground sausage)
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
* ½ teaspoon garlic powder or minced garlic
* 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning
* ¼ cup low-sodium chicken broth
* ½ teaspoon Cayenne pepper, optional
* ½ teaspoon paprika, optional
* Salt and fresh cracked pepper
* Fresh basil, chopped

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a food processor, reduce cauliflower florets to a rice consistency (or you may grate using a hand grater).
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add sausage and cook until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes. Remove from the skillet and set aside.
3. In the same skillet with 2 tablespoons olive oil, add the peppers and onion, and saute for 3-4 minutes. Add garlic, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper, cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add about 1/2 cup of chicken broth and whisk to combine. Allow the mixture to simmer for 1 minute, then add the paprika and cayenne.
4. Stir in the cooked cauliflower rice and sausage until combined. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper, if necessary. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve immediately. Enjoy!
