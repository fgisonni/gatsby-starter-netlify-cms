## INGREDIENTS

* 1 small head of broccoli (1/2 large head), cut into small florets
* 1+1/2 tablespoon coconut oil
* 1/2 long red chili, diced
* 1 tablespoon of finely diced or grated ginger
* 1/2 cup roasted cashew nuts
* 3 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1/4 teaspoon stevia
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* Juice of 1/4 lemon or 1/2 lime (about 1-2 tablespoons of juice)
* 250 g / 8 oz raw peeled prawns/shrimp (frozen prawns can be defrosted ahead of time)
* 2 large cloves garlic, finely diced

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Bring a kettle of water to a boil. Pour a few cups of boiling hot water to a pot and place over high heat. Add the broccoli and cook for 2 minutes. Strain and rinse under cold water. Set aside.
2. In the meantime, heat oil in a large frying pan or a wok. Add the chilli, ginger and cashew nuts and stir-fry for a minute, stirring frequently.
3. In a small bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, stevia, sesame oil and lemon or lime juice.
4. Add the shrimp to the pan and stir through for a minute, then add the garlic and stir for 30 more seconds.
5. Finally add the pre-cooked broccoli and the sauce and stir-fry together for a minute. Serve right away, while still nice and hot.
