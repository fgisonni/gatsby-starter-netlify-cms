![Mushroom, Kale & Egg Breakfast Plate](/img/mushroom-kale-egg-breakfast-plate.png)

## INGREDIENTS

* 1 tsp oil
* Half of a red onion, diced
* 2 cloves of garlic, minced
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* ½ teaspoon ground turmeric
* ¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
* 12 oz. (340 g.) mushrooms, sliced
* 4 oz. (113 g. / 4 large handfuls) roughly chopped kale
* 3 tablespoons water
* 2 eggs, scrambled
* Small handful of fresh cilantro, chopped

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. when hot, add the onion and sauté for a few minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion is almost translucent and soft (turn the heat down if the onion is browning too fast). add the garlic and sauté for 1 minute, stirring constantly, until the garlic is just beginning to turn lightly golden. Add the mushrooms and sauté for several minutes, turning occasionally, until nice and golden. transfer the mushrooms to a bowl.
2. Add the kale to the now empty skillet and, with the lid nearby, add the 3 tablespoons of water to the skillet and immediately cover the pan to trap the steam. Let the kale steam for 5 minutes before removing the lid to check on it. Stir then taste a piece to decide if you’d like to cook the kale any more. Once the kale is done to your liking, transfer it to a bowl.
3. Heat the now empty skillet over medium heat for a moment before adding the eggs. turn the heat down to low and cook the eggs gently to your preferred state of doneness.
4. To assemble the bowls, add the eggs, followed by the mushrooms, and finally the kale. sprinkle a bit of cilantro over each bowl and serve immediately.
