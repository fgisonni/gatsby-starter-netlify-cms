## INGREDIENTS

**For the chicken**

* 1 teaspoon olive oil
* ½ medium onion, diced
* 1 chicken breast (4oz)
* ½ large garlic clove, finely diced
* 1 teaspoon turmeric powder
* 1 teaspoon lime zest
* ½ teaspoon salt + pepper
* 4 broccolini stalks or 2 cups of broccoli florets
* 3 large kale leaves, stems removed and chopped
* ½ avocado, sliced
* Handful of fresh coriander leaves, chopped

**Dressing**

* 2 tablespoons lime juice
* 1/2 small garlic clove, finely diced or grated
* 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* ½ teaspoon stevia
* ½ teaspoon wholegrain or Dijon mustard
* ½ teaspoon sea salt and pepper

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Heat the oil in a small frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and sauté on medium heat for 4-5 minutes, until golden. Add the chicken mince and garlic and stir for 2-3 minutes over medium-high heat, breaking it apart.
2. Add the turmeric, lime zest, lime juice, salt and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, for a further 3-4 minutes. Set the cooked mince aside.
3. While the chicken is cooking, bring a small saucepan of water to boil. Add the broccolini and cook for 2 minutes. Rinse under cold water and cut into 3-4 pieces each.
4. Season with a little salt. Set aside.
5. Place chopped kale in a salad bowl and pour over the dressing. Using your hands, toss and massage the kale with the dressing. This will soften the kale.
6. Finally toss through the cooked chicken, broccolini, fresh herbs and avocado slices.
