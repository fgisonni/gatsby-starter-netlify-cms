## INGREDIENTS

* 2 cups kale, chopped
* 1/2 pint tomatoes, halved
* 3 slices extra thick-cut turkey bacon
* 1 tbsp mayonnaise
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice
* Salt to taste

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, olive oil, and lemon juice. Mix until you get a smooth mixture and add salt to taste.
2. Toss the kale leaves with the dressing and use your hands to evenly coat for 2-3 minutes. Set aside and let sit at room temperature for 20 minutes.
3. In the meantime, heat up a large skillet over medium heat. Place the turkey bacon slices into the pan and allow it to cook for 7-8 minutes on each side.
4. Once the turkey bacon is ready, transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels. Cut each slice of turkey bacon in half.
5. Add the tomatoes to the salad bowl and mix until theyâ€™re fully coated in the dressing.
6. Divide the salad between two plates, top with cooked turkey bacon slices, and serve immediately.
