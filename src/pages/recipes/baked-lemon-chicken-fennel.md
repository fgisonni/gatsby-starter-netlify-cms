## INGREDIENTS

* 1 tbsp olive oil
* ½ lemon, juiced
* ½ lemon, sliced
* 1 tsp dijon mustard
* ½ tsp stevia
* 1 medium fennel bulbs trimmed, halved lengthwise, and then cut each half into 4 wedges
* 1 chicken breast (4 oz)
* Several fresh sprigs of thyme, leaves removed
* Salt & freshly ground pepper
* Flat leaf parsley to garnish

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Set oven to 475F
2. Mix the first 5 ingredients together in a bowl to make the sauce, and set aside.
3. In a baking dish or baking sheet arrange the chicken, skin side up, fennel and lemon slices. Everything should be more or less in one layer so the chicken will brown nicely.
4. Sprinkle everything with salt and fresh cracked pepper. Pour half of the sauce over all.
5. Put the pan into the hot oven. The high temperature is important, make sure you are at 475F. Let the chicken roast for about 35-45 minutes until everything is browned. Rotate the pan halfway through if your oven heats unevenly.
6. Meanwhile take the other half of the sauce and put it in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and reduce it a bit. Pour this over the chicken about 10 minutes before it is finished cooking.
7. Serve the chicken garnished with some fresh parsley.
