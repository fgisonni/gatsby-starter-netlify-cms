## INGREDIENTS:

* 2 medium zucchinis (650 grams)
* ½ pound ground beef
* ¼ cup diced tomatoes
* 1 cups pasta sauce, divided
* 1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
* Optional toppings: fresh basil, nutritional yeast, red pepper flakes.

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Pour 1/2 cup pasta sauce in a large glass baking dish and set aside.
2. Make the zucchini boats. Cut bottom and top off the zucchini and then cut in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, hollow out the center of the zucchini halves, leaving about 1/4-1/2 inch shell. Place flesh side up in glass baking dish.
3. Place a large sauté pan over medium heat. Once it gets hot, about 30 seconds, add in ground beef, breaking it up with a spoon. Sauté 4-5 minutes until browned. Add in diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, and 1 cup pasta sauce. Stir to combine and remove from heat once incorporated.
4. Stuff the zucchini boats with the beef dividing it up equally, about 1/2 cup per each boat. Cover pan with foil and bake for 30 minutes until zucchini is cooked through, but still has some firmness. Top with optional toppings and enjoy!
