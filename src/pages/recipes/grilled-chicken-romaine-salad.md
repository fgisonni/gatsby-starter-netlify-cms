## INGREDIENTS

**Dressing:**

* 1 clove garlic
* 2oz anchovy filets (~6 filets) or 2 tsp anchovy paste (optional)
* 1 tbsp lemon juice (juice of 1-2 lemons), more to taste
* 1 tsp dijon mustard
* 1tbsp cup mayonnaise
* Â½ pint grape tomatoes
* 1 chicken breasts, sliced
* 1 hearts of romaine lettuce, sliced in half lengthwise

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat your oven to 400F. Toss the tomatoes with a bit of olive oil, salt, and pepper, then place on a baking sheet lined with parchment pepper, facing cut-side up. Roast until dark in color and somewhat dry looking, about 20 minutes.
2. Prep the chicken for grilling. Place the chicken flat on a cutting board, then slice each breast in half lengthwise to make 2 thin butterflied cutlets. Toss with ~1 tbsp olive oil and some salt and pepper, Place chicken in oven safe dish; insert into oven alongside tomatoes (you may place on the same baking sheet if you like). Bake until grilled through the center and no longer pink.
3. While the chicken and tomatoes bake, chop the garlic and anchovy into a paste, then add to a mixing bowl. Whisk in the remaining ingredients, add salt and pepper to taste, and add a bit more lemon juice if the dressing gets too thick.
4. Check on the chicken - when cooked through, remove both tomatoes and chicken.
5. Set oven to broil, brush the romaine with olive oil and set cut side up into the oven for a few minutes until it browns.
6. While lettuce is broiling, slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces.
7. Once lettuce is slightly charred, remove from oven. Place the lettuce cut-side-up, then scatter with chicken and roasted tomatoes; drizzle with the dressing.
