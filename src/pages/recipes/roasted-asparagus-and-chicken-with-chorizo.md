## INGREDIENTS

* 1 large onion, diced
* 1 medium red pepper, diced
* 1/2 teaspoon paprika powder
* 1/2 teaspoon onion powder (optional)
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin powder
* Pinch of dried coriander or thyme
* Generous pinch of salt and pepper
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 4-5 chicken tenderloins, cut into 3 pieces each (see notes for alternatives)
* 1 teaspoon paprika
* 1/4 teaspoon cumin powder
* Generous pinch of salt
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* asparagus spears (1 bunch), ends trimmed
* 2 cloves garlic, finely diced
* 2 tablespoons lemon juice
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* Generous pinch of salt

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 210 C / 410 F. While the oven is heating up, prepare the ingredients.
2. In a mixing bowl, combine the onion and peppers, spices, salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon juice. Spread the mixture on an ovenproof flat sheet pan.
3. Mix the chicken ingredients in the same bowl, using your hands to rub the chicken pieces evenly. Spread the chicken pieces on top of the onion and peppers. Place in the oven, middle shelf, for 10 minutes.
4. In the meantime, combine the asparagus with garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and salt and set aside. After 10 minutes, remove the sheet pan from the oven. Scatter the asparagus spears amongst the chicken and sprinkle with the remaining garlic and juices. Turn the heat down to 200 C / 400 F and place the tray back in for 7 minutes. Remove from the tray and serve while hot.
