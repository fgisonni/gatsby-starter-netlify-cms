## INGREDIENTS

* 1/2 bunch asparagus
* 1 tablespoon olive oil or other cooking oil
* 1 large onion, finely chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/2 pound ground turkey
* 1 red jalapenos or 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper (optional)
* 1 tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
* 1 scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Grab your asparagus and get chopping! Start by trimming the tough ends off. I keep the thick rubber bands on the asparagus, spy where the ends morph from green to whitish (the tough part), and slice through the whole bundle at that point.
2. Next, discard the tough ends in the compost bin and slice the asparagus crosswise into Â½-inch thick coins, down to the tips.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. When the pan is hot, swirl in the cooking fat so you have a thin layer of fat coating the bottom.
4. As soon as the fat is shimmering, toss in the onion and a sprinkle of salt.
5. Cook, stirring, for a couple minutes or until the onion are softened.
6. Toss in the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
7. Add the ground turkey and break it up with spatula.
8. Sprinkle on some salt and increase the heat to medium-high.
9. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes or until no longer pink.
10. Toss in the asparagus coins.
11. Add chili flakes or the red jalapeno (finely diced)
12. Stir in the soy sauce, vinegar, fish sauce, and sesame oil. (You can measure out the seasonings ahead of time in a small bowl, and then dump everything in all at once. I did it all separately, but only so we could take these pretty pictures.)
13. Turn off the heat and taste a bite. If necessary, adjust the seasoning to your liking.
14. Top with scallions and serve!
