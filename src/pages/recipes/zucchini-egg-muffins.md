## INGREDIENTS

* 1 medium zucchini to yield 1 cups of zucchini shreds  
* 1/4 cup red onion diced  
* 2 egg large; lightly beaten  
* 1/8 teaspoon salt optional  
* ½ red pepper  
* ½ cucumber

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Using a grater with large holes, grate zucchini into shreds.
3. Spread zucchini shreds out on a clean dish towel.  Close towel and turn to squeeze out excess moisture.
4. Measure 1 cup of zucchini shreds for this recipe and reserve any leftover shreds for another use.
5. Combine ingredients in a large bowl.
6. Scoop mixture into mini muffin tins coated to prevent sticking (you can use silicon muffin cups if you like).  Press the mixture down with the back of a spoon to tightly compact in each muffin tin well.
7. Bake for 25 minutes or until firm and starting to brown.
8. While baking, slice pepper into thin strips; slice zucchini into strips. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
9. Serve egg muffins with pepper slices and cucumber on side.
