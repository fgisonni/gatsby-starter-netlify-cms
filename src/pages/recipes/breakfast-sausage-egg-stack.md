## INGREDIENTS

- Oil for frying
- Sausage meat (6 oz)
- 2 large eggs
- Salt and pepper to taste

**Quick Guacamole:**

- 1 medium avocado (150 g/ 5.3 oz)
- 1/2 small white or yellow onion, chopped (35 g/ 1.2 oz)
- 2 tbsp fresh lime juice (30 ml/ 1 fl oz)
- Salt and pepper to taste

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Prepare the quick guacamole. Halve the avocado and scoop into a bowl. Add the lime juice, onion, salt and pepper. Mash using a fork and set aside.
2. Heat a pan greased with half of the ghee over a medium heat. Using your hands, create small patties from the sausage meat. Place on the pan and cook undisturbed for 2-3 minutes. Flip on the other side and cook for 1-2 more minutes and set aside.
3. Grease the pan with the remaining ghee and crack in the eggs. Cook until the egg whites are cooked through and the egg yolks are still runny. If you use an egg mold like this one, make sure to lower the heat, as it will take longer to cook through.
4. When done, top each patty with the prepared guacamole and fried egg. Season with salt and pepper to taste and eat immediately.
5. Meal-prep tip: You can prepare the guacamole and fry the sausage patties in advance and keep in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Serve with fried or poached egg.
