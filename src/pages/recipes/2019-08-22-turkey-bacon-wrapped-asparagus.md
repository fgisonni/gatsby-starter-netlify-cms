## INGREDIENTS

* 1/2 bunch asparagus
* 3 slices uncured turkey bacon
* 1/2 tbsp olive oil
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp paprika
* 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
* Salt and pepper to taste

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 425.
2. Line a baking sheet with foil or a non-stick cooking spray. OR cover a baking sheet with a baking rack (to drain the grease from the turkey bacon).
3. Bundle asparagus into groups of 3 or 4 and wrap with one piece of turkey bacon. Place spread apart on baking ban/rack.
4. Drizzle olive oil and sprinkle seasoning on top of the bundles.
5. Bake for 20-25 minutes depending on desired crispiness of turkey bacon. Serve immediately.

\*Can serve on side of veggie soup or mixed green salad (top with avocado, pepper, olive oil and lemon juice!)
