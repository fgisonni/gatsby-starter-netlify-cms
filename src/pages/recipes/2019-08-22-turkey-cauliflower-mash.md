## INGREDIENTS

* 100g extra lean turkey breast
* 1 small whole cauliflower
* 2 cups asparagus
* 2 tbsp. chives
* Sea salt and pepper to taste

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Season turkey with salt and pepper.
2. Place turkey on non-stick frying pan over medium heat, moving the pan around quickly so it doesn’t stick.
3. Once cooked, add asparagus with trimmed ends. Season to taste and cook until tender.
4. In another pot, boil cauliflower until very tender.
5. Drain and discard all the water – the drier the cauliflower the better.
6. Add almond milk, salt and pepper, and mash with potato masher until it looks like mashed potatoes.
7. Top with chives.
