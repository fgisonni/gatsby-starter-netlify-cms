## INGREDIENTS

* ½  onion, cut in slivers
* 1 /2 red bell pepper, cut in thin strips
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 cloves garlic, cut in slices (for seasoning the oil)
* 1 cups chopped basil leaves
* 1/2 lb. lean ground turkey

**STIR FRY SAUCE INGREDIENTS**

* 1 tbsp fresh-squeezed lemon juice
* 1 tbsp soy sauce (I used Tamari Gluten Free Soy Sauce)
* 1/2 tsp stevia

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Whisk together the lime juice, soy sauce, and stevia to make the stir-fry sauce.
2. Cut the onion and pepper into thin slivers. Peel and slice the garlic.
3. Heat the frying pan over med heat for about 1 minute before you add the oil.
4. Add the 1 tablespoon of oil, heat about 30 seconds (or until it looks shimmery).
5. Add the garlic cloves, and cook the garlic just until it’s fragrant.  When you smell garlic (less than one minute) remove the garlic into a bowl and set aside.
6. Add the onion slivers and bell pepper strips stir-fry for 1-2 minutes (just until they’re starting to soften), then remove same bowl as garlic.
7. Add the other teaspoon of oil if it seem like you need it and add the ground turkey and stir-fry 5 minutes, breaking apart with a turner as it cooks.
8. Cook the turkey until any liquid evaporates completely and the turkey is starting to get lightly browned.
9. Add the vegetables back into pan, stirring to combine with the meat, and cook about 1 minute.
10. Add the chopped basil and cook about 1 minute more, just until the basil starts to wilt.
11. Then add the stir-fry sauce and stir to distribute it in the meat/veggie mixture.
12. Cook about 2 minutes more, or until the sauce is mostly absorbed into the meat and the whole dish is hot.
