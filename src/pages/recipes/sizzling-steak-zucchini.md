## INGREDIENTS

* 175g lean strip steak (preferably grass-fed)
* 3 cups zucchini
* Salt & pepper to taste
* 1 tsp. fresh thyme, chopped
* 1 tsp. fresh oregano, chopped
* 1 tsp. fresh parsley, chopped

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Wash zucchini, cut off the ends, and slice into pieces.
2. Place zucchini in cast-iron frying pan or Pyrex glass cooking sheet and sprinkle with salt.
3. Roast zucchini on the top rack of your oven at 450°F for 7-10 minutes. Also, pre-heat non-stick pan on the stovetop set at medium to medium-high heat for 5 minutes.
4. Season strip steak with salt and pepper.
5. Place steak on heated frying pan, moving the pan around quickly so it doesn’t stick. Wait until seared and flip.
