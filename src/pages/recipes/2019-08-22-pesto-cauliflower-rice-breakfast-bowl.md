![Pesto Cauliflower Rice Breakfast Bowl](/img/presto-cauliflower-rice-breakfast-bowl.png)

## INGREDIENTS

* 1/2 medium cauliflower head
* 1/2 tablespoon olive oil extra virgin
* 1 tbsp pesto of your choice
* 2 cups spinach loosely packed
* 1 avocado diced
* 2 eggs
* Salt & pepper to taste

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Cut cauliflower into small florets. Shred using a grater or chop cauliflower into rice like consistency. Set aside your cauliflower rice to a bowl until youâ€™re ready to add it to your skillet.
2. In a large skillet heat 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the cauliflower to the pan a cook for 5-8 minutes until the cauliflower gets tender. As it heats up the cauliflower will release water. Just keep cooking and stirring until the cauliflower loses some of that moisture.
3. Once tender, mix the pesto into the cauliflower and stir well to combine. At this point you'll only need to keep the rice on the heat another minute or two just to warm the pesto.
4. Once mixed and heated divide the cauliflower rice equally into a bowl. Top the cauliflower with spinach & avocado and set aside for a few minutes as you cook your eggs.
5. Wipe down the pan you were using and return it to the stove top and set to a medium heat. Add the remaining 1/2 olive oil and warm.
6. Crack eggs into the pan. Let the eggs cook a few minutes undisturbed on to let the whites cook. After a couple of minutes cover the pan with a fitted lid for 1-2 minutes and let the steam from the pan cook the tops. Once the eggs are cooked to your liking turn off the heat and gently transfer each egg to your bowls.
7. Have your salt & pepper ready to season to your tase.
