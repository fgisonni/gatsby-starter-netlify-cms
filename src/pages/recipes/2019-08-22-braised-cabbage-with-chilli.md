## INGREDIENTS

* 1 medium zucchini, diced into large cubes
* 1 tablespoons olive oil
* 1 medium onion, diced
* 1 long red chilli, seeds out and diced
* 1 stick of celery, diced
* 1 large clove of garlic, finely diced
* 1/2 head of medium white cabbage, quartered and shredded (core out)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon coriander seed powder
* 1/2 cup diced tomatoes
* Handful of fresh coriander/cilantro or parsley, chopped

## INSTRUCTIONS

1. Heat olive oil over medium heat in a large pot or a deep frying pan that has a lid. Add the onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring half way. Then add the chilli, celeryand sauté for 3-4 minutes, until slightly softened and caramelised.
2. Now add the zucchini, garlic and cabbage and season with salt and coriander seed powder. Stir through, cover with the lid and cook for 2-3 minutes. The cabbage will release a bit of juice and reduce in size.
3. Finally, add the diced tomatoes, cooked potatoes and about 1/3 cup of water. Stir through and cover with a lid. Bring the heat down to medium-low and cook for 15 minutes, stirring a couple of times. Finish by topping off with fresh herbs.
